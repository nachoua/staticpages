                                    This Privacy Policy applies to https://www.petpro.ae (hereinafter, <span

                                    We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable
                                    information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy
                                    policy (“Privacy Policy”) to explain what information may be collected on our
                                    Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose
                                    the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we
                                    collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from
                                    other sources. This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on
                                    our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our
                                    Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required
                                    to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>
                                    <h2 class="st-title2">WEBSITE VISITORS</h2>
                                <p class="st-pg1">Like most website operators, Petpro.ae collects
                                    non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers
                                    typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
                                    site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Petpro.ae’s purpose in
                                    collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
                                    Petpro.ae’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Petpro.ae may release
                                    non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a
                                    report on trends in the usage of its website. Petpro.ae also collects potentially
                                    personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged
                                    in users and for users leaving comments on https://www.petpro.ae blog posts.
                                    Petpro.ae only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
                                    circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as
                                    described below.</p>
                                    
                                <h2 class="st-title2">GATHERING OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</h2>
                                <p class="st-pg1">Certain visitors to Petpro.ae’s websites choose to interact with
                                    Petpro.ae in ways that require Petpro.ae to gather personally-identifying
                                    information. The amount and type of information that Petpro.ae gathers depends on
                                    the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a
                                    newsletter at https://www.petpro.ae to provide a username and email address.</p>
                                    
                                <h2 class="st-title2">SECURITY</h2>
                                <p class="st-pg1">The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but
                                    remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
                                    storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to
                                    protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
                                       <h2 class="st-title2">LINKS TO EXTERNAL SITES</h2>
                                <p class="st-pg1">Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated
                                    by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third
                                    party’s site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms and
                                    conditions of every site you visit. We have no control over, and assume no
                                    responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party

                                    <h2 class="st-title2">HTTPS://WWW.PETPRO.AE USES GOOGLE ADWORDS FOR REMARKETING</h2>
                                <p class="st-pg1">https://www.petpro.ae uses the remarketing services to advertise on
                                    third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. It could
                                    mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on our
                                    site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry. This could be in the
                                    form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google
                                    Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads
                                    based on someone’s past visits. Of course, any data collected will be used in
                                    accordance with our own privacy policy and Google’s privacy policy. You can set
                                    preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page,
                                    and if you want to you can opt-out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie
                                    settings or permanently using a browser plugin.</p>
                                    
                                <p class="st-pg1">Petpro.ae discloses potentially personally-identifying and
                                    personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and
                                    affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process
                                    it on Petpro.ae’s behalf or to provide services available at Petpro.ae’s website,
                                    and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,
                                    contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home
                                    country; by using Petpro.ae’s website, you consent to the transfer of such

                                    personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than
                                    to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above,
                                    Petpro.ae discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
                                    information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental
                                    request, or when Petpro.ae believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably
                                    necessary to protect the property or rights of Petpro.ae, third parties or the
                                    public at large. If you are a registered user of https://www.petpro.ae and have
                                    supplied your email address, Petpro.ae may occasionally send you an email to tell
                                    you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with
                                    what’s going on with Petpro.ae and our products. We primarily use our blog to
                                    communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a
                                    minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our
                                    feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify
                                    or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Petpro.ae takes all
                                    measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
                                    alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
                                    personally-identifying information.</p>
